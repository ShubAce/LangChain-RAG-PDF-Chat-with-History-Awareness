# LangChain-RAG-PDF-Chat-with-History-Awareness
This project is a Streamlit-based application that enables users to chat with the contents of uploaded PDF documents using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It combines the capabilities of LangChain, Chroma vector store, HuggingFace embeddings, and Groqâ€™s Gemma2-9b-It language model to deliver accurate, context-aware answers.
